# Folio Route Analysis Plan

## Objective

To ascertain the current usage and configuration of Laravel Folio within the project. This is crucial given the new architectural directive to use Folio, Volt, and Filament for front-office development, and to understand which routes are already handled by Folio's file-based routing.

## Method

Execute the Laravel Artisan command: `php artisan folio:list`

## Expected Output

The command is expected to display a list of all routes registered by Laravel Folio. This list will include the URI paths, the corresponding Blade files, and any associated middleware.

## Expected Learnings

1.  **Confirmation of Folio Usage:** Determine definitively if Laravel Folio is actively routing pages in the current project setup.
2.  **Identification of Existing Folio Pages:** Understand which current frontend pages (if any) are already being served via Folio. This will guide future development to maintain consistency.
3.  **Architectural Alignment:** Evaluate the current Folio routes against the project's overall structure and the goal of using Folio for all front-office routing.
4.  **Gaps Analysis:** Identify any missing Folio routes for planned pages (e.g., `dashboard`, `profile`, dynamic event pages) that would need to be created.

## Planned Next Steps (Post-Execution)

1.  Analyze the output of `php artisan folio:list`.
2.  Synthesize the findings, noting any existing Folio routes and their patterns.
3.  Update `Themes/Meetup/docs/project-completion-plan.md` or `Themes/Meetup/docs/folio-volt-best-practices.md` if the findings provide new, critical insights or require adjustments to the plan.
4.  Inform the user of the output and the implications for the project's frontend routing strategy.
