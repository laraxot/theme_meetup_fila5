# Prompt Corrections Summary - February 9, 2026

## Overview
Comprehensive correction of all prompts in `laravel/Themes/Meetup/docs/replikate/` to fix critical errors and ensure alignment with LaravelPizza brand and architecture.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Wrong Brand Content**
All prompts contained references to "Marco Sottana - Consulenza Sicurezza" instead of LaravelPizza:
- ❌ "Marco Sottana - Consulenza Sicurezza"
- ❌ "Odontoiatria", "Medicina Veterinaria"
- ❌ "Radioprotezione", "Biosicurezza"
- ❌ "Via Vanzo 86/A, Mogliano Veneto TV"
- ❌ Medical/dental compliance content

### 2. **Wrong Color Palette**
Prompts described colors from a different business:
- Wrong: #1e3a5f (navy blue), #2563eb (blue), #059669 (emerald)
- Correct: #0f172a (slate-900 bg), #dc2626 (red-600 accent), #1e293b (slate-800 cards), #0b1120 (slate-950 footer)

### 3. **Missing Context**
- No mention of URL mapping (flat vs multilingual)
- No mention of theme workflow (npm run build + npm run copy)
- Incomplete architectural rules
