# Metatags Blade Syntax Error Fix

## Objective

To resolve the `ParseError - Internal Server Error: syntax error, unexpected end of file, expecting "elseif" or "else" or "endif"` occurring in `Themes/Meetup/resources/views/components/layouts/main.blade.php`. This error is caused by a Blade syntax issue due to redundant asset directives being passed to the `<x-metatags>` component.

## Problem Description

Despite correctly structuring `main.blade.php` to call the `<x-metatags>` component, a `ParseError` persists. The error message "syntax error, unexpected end of file, expecting 'elseif' or 'else' or 'endif'" at `main.blade.php:20` (which corresponds to the `<body>` tag) strongly indicates an unclosed Blade directive or a structural error *within the content rendered by `<x-metatags>`*.

## Analysis & Hypothesis

The `<x-metatags>` component (defined by `Modules/Cms/View/Components/Metatags.php` and rendering `Modules/Cms/resources/views/components/metatags.blade.php`) has been analyzed. It has been confirmed that this component:

1.  Renders the entire HTML `<head>` tag.
2.  Includes its own `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` directives internally.
3.  Includes a `{{ $slot }}` directive within its own `<head>` tag.

My previous attempt to fix `main.blade.php` involved passing `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` *as slot content* to `<x-metatags>`. This resulted in:

*   **Redundant Directives:** The `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` directives were being rendered twice (once from `main.blade.php`'s slot, and once from within `metatags.blade.php`).
*   **Blade Parser Confusion:** This redundancy, particularly with `{{ $slot }}` allowing content from `main.blade.php` to be inserted *before* the internally called `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` within `metatags.blade.php`, creates an invalid Blade compilation structure. The Blade compiler interprets the duplicate directives as unexpected syntax, leading to the `ParseError`.

*   **Hypothesis:** The `ParseError` is directly caused by passing `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` as slot content to `<x-metatags>`, when these directives are already correctly handled internally by `metatags.blade.php`.

## Affected Files

*   `Themes/Meetup/resources/views/components/layouts/main.blade.php` (where the incorrect slot content is passed)
*   `Modules/Cms/resources/views/components/metatags.blade.php` (which correctly contains internal asset calls)

## Planned Next Steps

1.  **Correct `main.blade.php`:** Modify `Themes/Meetup/resources/views/components/layouts/main.blade.php` to call `<x-metatags />` as a self-closing component, removing any slot content (specifically the `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` directives) from within its tags.
2.  Re-attempt `php artisan serve` (or refresh the browser) to verify the fix.
3.  Inform the user of the resolution and update relevant documentation.
